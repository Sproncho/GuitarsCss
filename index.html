        <h2>Telecaster</h2>
        <p>Leo Fender set out to create a guitar that would be cost effective to make, and have the bright clean tone which was
        then associated with country music. The full solid body with the bolt on neck have since become common but were an
        innovation in the early 50’s. Originally named ‘Broadcaster’ the name was quickly changed (because of copyrights) to
        Telecaster and became the longest selling production guitar in history. The simplicity of two single coil pickups, the
        removable pickguard control plate and the removable neck made servicing and assembling the guitar much easier than
        before.</p>

        <h2>Stratocaster</h2>
        <p>The Stratocaster is one of the most popular if not the number one guitar in history. The irregular double cutaway shape
        is almost synonymous with the term ‘electric guitar’. The shape and sound of the Strat has been copied and replicated by
        many companies and guitar builders. Arriving to the world at 1954 the Strat followed the Telecaster and was designed to
        be more and better than it’s sibling.</p>

        <h2>Les Paul</h2>
        <p>If you are not a Fender fan, chances are you are a Les Paul lover (and yes, you can love both) The The Gibson made Les
        Paul arrived on 1952 with the help of then guitarist Les Paul. It was Gibson’s first production solid Body guitar to
        rival the Telecaster. The Les Paul used a single cutaway and two single coil pickups but used a set-in neck, mahogany
        body and neck and a 24.75” scale length.</p>
